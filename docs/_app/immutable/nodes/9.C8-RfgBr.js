While easy to compute, this method produces misleading results that do not reflect actual capital allocation.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The weighted average, by contrast, provides the accurate cost basis that matches your real investment performance.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">What is Simple Arithmetic Average</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">A simple average adds all purchase prices together and divides by the number of transactions, treating each buy equally regardless of size. For purchases at $50, $60, and $70, the simple average is $60.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">The Problem with Simple Averaging</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">If you bought vastly different quantities at each price, the simple average ignores allocation weight. Buying 100 units at $70 and only 10 units at $50 yields a simple average of $60, but your actual cost is much closer to $70 due to the larger position.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Weighted Average Reflects Reality</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The weighted average multiplies each price by its quantity, sums total cost, then divides by total units. In the same example, total cost is 100 times 70 plus 10 times 50 equals 7500. Total quantity is 110 units. The weighted average is approximately $68.18, far closer to your dominant purchase price.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Why the Difference Matters</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Using the wrong average distorts your breakeven point and profit calculations. The simple average can make positions appear more favorable than they are when larger buys occurred at higher prices, or vice versa. Performance tracking becomes inaccurate, leading to poor decisions.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Common Scenarios Where It Fails</h2> <ul class="svelte-q8x3kg"><li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Scaling into positions with increasing size</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Dollar-cost averaging with fixed amounts over time</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Averaging down with larger follow-on purchases</li> <li class="svelte-q8x3kg">Any situation with uneven position sizes</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Always Use Weighted Average</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Your portfolio performance is measured against actual dollars invested, not the number of transactions. The weighted average matches how exchanges and brokers calculate cost basis for tax and reporting purposes. It aligns perfectly with realized gains or losses when selling.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The weighted average calculator eliminates confusion by always applying the correct method automatically.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Choosing the right averaging method ensures your mental model matches financial reality.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">Weighted averaging is not just more accurate. It is the only method that truly represents your investment cost.</p></article></div>');function C(p){var e=q();x("q8x3kg",m=>{var s=k(),v=d(u(s),6);t(4),r(()=>n(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),y(()=>{f.title="Comparing Weighted Average vs. Simple Arithmetic Average | Blog"}),i(m,s)});var a=l(e),h=l(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),r(()=>n(h,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(p,e)}export{C as component,T as universal};
